## Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that lets you improve plaintext text documents. It is one of the most popular markup languages worldwide. It differs from Microsoft Word because you don't immediately see the result of your changes. Markdown is helpful because it acts as a bridge between unrendered text and the finished product. 
It's goal is to be as readable as possible. Markdown is also platform independent, not locked to a proprietary format like Word is, and it is platform independent so can be used on any operating system.

* To create a heading in Markdown, we use the pound symbol. One pound is the largest heading and six is the smallest.
* To bold or italicize text, you use the asterisk symbol at the beginning and end of the text you want to alter. One asterisk italicizes, while two bolds the text.
* To create a link in Markdown we use the square brackets to communicate the symbol of the link, such as [Ben's Reading Notes](https://github.com/halliwellb/reading-notes/)
We use the parenthesis to tell Markdown what link to input for the symbol. There is no space between the last square bracket and first parenthesis.
* To create an unordered list in Markdown we can use the asterisk symbol, the hyphen, or the plus symbol.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a way to illustrate your work and reach a broader audience very efficiently. GitHub will publish the work you save to your page which automatically updates the link for future users, freeing up the creator.

* You can upload files to GitHub Pages by dragging and dropping them to the spot in the file you want them to appear.
