# Operators and Loops

## Operators and loops are very helpful to ensure any information requests made by you to users of your site are acted upon, without the site appearing broken. They can also make the site more engaging and interesting for the user.

### (1.) *An expression in JavaScript* is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators). Said another way, it takes a symbol and assigns meaning to it based on input.

### (2.) *We would use a loop in our code* to ensure the user takes the action we have requested, without the site appearing broken.

### (3.) *A for loop stops executing* when the input is false. Such as, "What is your name?" if the user enters their name, the loop will not execute as the argument would have asked whether the user entered a blank response. If they had, the loop would ask their name until they input a response.

### (4.) A *while loop* has the potential to infinitely loop, if not coded properly. Each run through the loop should add a lap, and there should be some set number of laps that cause the loop to terminate.
