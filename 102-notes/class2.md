# The Coder's Computer

This topic matters because our computer is our toolbox. Without a thorough understanding of what we currently have available in our toolbox, we will not be at our best
when using the tools. We also won't fully understand what tools could make our work better! This topic is the beginning of our foundation for success.

## Things I want to know more about
    
   + What is the preference some people have for Windows over Linux or vice-versa?
   + Is it beneficial to have a profile within your terminal? I.E. should you run commands through halliwellb or is Root simpler?

## Text Editors

The one thing to remember is that there's no one "right" editor. You will be using this application **a lot** so choose one that you're comfortable with and work efficiently on.

### (1.) Some features to look for in a text editor (4 suggestions, plus a reminder)

+ Code completion
  + This will offer suggestions of code as you type, might provide closing tags or brackets, etc.
  + **Emmet** is a shorthand language that can speed up your code writing and some text editors have it built in, while others require an extension to be added
+ Syntax Highlighting
  + Syntax highlighting can make finding an error in your code much simpler as elements, copy, and attributes all appear as different colors.
  + This can also make your code more organized and easier to read
+ Variety of themes to pick from
  + Helpful to have options of background color that contrasts well with the text.
  + This can reduce fatigue and eye strain
+ Robust extensions
  + As you get better, extensions can become an important piece of your toolbox.
  + Having a great amount of options from the beginning can save having to change editors midway through.
+ Whatever your personal preferences are above that!
  + Again, there is no one "right" editor!!

  ### Pre-installed options
  
    + Windows comes with *Notepad* and Mac comes with *Text Edit*
    + Linux comes with a text editor, but depends on the setup

## The command line

Can be helpful to have multiple terminals open at one time to make work more efficient.
When typing a command, must separate the command with the first command line argument.
After the command has run and the terminal is ready to continue, the prompt will display again (root@Bens_Lenovo)
Commands are stored in a history. After you enter a command and continue to the prompt, you can hit the up and down arrow keys to move between past commands. 
This can be a big time saver for repeat tasks.

## (2.) Commands

+ pwd = Print Working Directory
+ ls = List (with no arguments, ls will list current location)
+ cd = Change Directory (with no arguments, cd will take you to home directory)
+ mkdir = Make Directory
+ touch = Creates a blank file if we refer to a file and it does not exist

  ### File types

    + file.exe = executable file or program
    + file.txt = plain text file
    + file.png, file.jpg, file.gif = image file

## (3.) Explanations of commands and arguments
+ cd projects = **Telling the terminal to take us to directory "projects"**
+ mkdir new-project = **Creating a new directory "new-project"**
+ touch new-project/newfile.md = **Telling the terminal to go to "newfile.md" within "new-project"; if not present, create a new file**
+ cd.. = **With no arguments, cd will take us back to the home directory; with arguments, will take us to the location specified**
+ ls projects/new-project = **We are telling ls to not list our current directory, but rather the contents of the specified directory**
