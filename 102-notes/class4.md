# HTML and WireFraming

### HTML

(1.) HTML is the structure of a website. It acts as the skeleton and allows for minimal visual improvement as that is not its main role.

### Three main parts of HTML

(2.) The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, closing tag, and the content. These all make up the element.

### Attribute

(3.) Giving an element extra information is called adding an attribute to the element. This extra information won't appear in the final content but allows you to more easily target the element.

### Semantic element

(4.) A semantic element helps give meaning to the code and makes it more understandable for technology and other developers. It also helps the markup to recommend data.
