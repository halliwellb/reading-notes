# CSS

##  CSS adds pizzazz to a website. It is like the skin and presents a much nicer front than HTML alone. We can use CSS to make the website visually appealing and add different textures to entice users.

### (1.) The purpose of CSS is to present a document in a more visually appealing manner. It can also be used for animation and to alter the layout of a webpage.

### (2.) Three ways to insert CSS into a project are *External CSS*, *Internal CSS*, and *Inline CSS*. It is important to note that *Inline CSS* has the highest priority for formatting, followed by *External and Internal CSS*, followed by the *Browser Default CSS*.

**External CSS** uses a seperate file type that is linked to an HTML document, telling it how to style the HTML. This is the preferred manner of using CSS.

**Internal CSS** applies the CSS directly in the HTML document. This sounds convenient, but can easily lead to a very confusing and cluttered HTML document. Although Internal CSS can be helpful for formatting one specific page of an HTML document.

**Inline CSS** applies the CSS directly to the line of code in the HTML document. This is helpful for altering a specific piece of a broader file.

### (3.) In order to make all <p> a red color, you would use 

p {
  color: red;
}
