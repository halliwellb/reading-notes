# Programming with JavaScript

## JavaScript is a very dynamic programming language that can offer many improvements when added to HTML and CSS.

(1.) *Control flow* is the order that the computer executes your statements in a script. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) The control flow is by default read top to bottom, but can be altered with conditionals and loops and frequently is.

(2.) *A JavaScript function* is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) An example would be asking for a visitor's name when they first visit your website. They are very helpful because when written correctly they can be reused many times without having to redo the work.

(3.) When you *invoke or call a function* it is executed or acted upon per your instructions. The () tell the code what to consider in the function result.

(4.) *The parenthesis are for* telling JavaScript what elements to consider when you define a function. If you don't use the (), then the code will return the function object rather than the function result.
