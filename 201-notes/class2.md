# Class Two notes

## HTML

### (1.) Semantics are important because they give meaning to our code. This makes the webpage more readable, but also helps any developers who read our code, or ourselves if we return to a block of code after a period away.

### (2.) There are six levels of headings in HTML; h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, from largest (h1) to smallest (h6).

### (3.) Sup is superscript and Sub is subscript. Sup can make text appear as "raised to the nth power" while sub can make text appear such as a chemistry formula.

### (4.) Abbr is short for abbreviations. You must include the title= attribute to provide the full expansion of the term.

## CSS

### (1.) We can apply CSS to our HTML in a similar manner to JavaScript. We can apply CSS internally or externally. To apply externally, we use the link rel= attribute to connect a .css file to our HTML. To apply CSS internally, we enclose our CSS around style tags.

### (2.) Inline styles can make the code bulky and cluttered. They don't add value to the readability of the code, and actually subtract from it in most cases.

### (3.) 1. h2 is representing the selector. 2. The CSS declarations are "color: black" and "padding: 5px". 3. The properties are color and padding in the example.

## JS

### (1.) Data enclosed in single or double quote marks is string data.

### (2.) Four types of JavaScript operators are Assignment, Addition, Strict Equality, and Multiplication.

### (3.) A real world problem that you could solve with a function is adding the users name in at multiple points on the site, or multiple pages of your site. The function can store the value the user inputs.

## Decisions, decisions

### (1.) An if statement checks a true or false and if it evaluates true, the code will execute.

### (2.) An else if statement is helpful for an alternative to a straight true evaluation. For example, "if user enters name, evaluate true and execute code. If else answer is blank, repeat asking name". The else statement tells the code to do something different if the evaluation is false.

### (3.) === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another. < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another. <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

### (4.) && AND lets you force all expressions evaluate true for the whole expression to evaluate true, while || OR lets the whole expression evaluate true if one or more of the statements evaluates true.
