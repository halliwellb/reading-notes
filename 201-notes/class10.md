# Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. `Syntax errors` are typically spelling errors, while `Logic errors` have the correct syntax, but the outcome of the code is not what we intended. Another `syntax error` could be puncuation in the wrong place, and another `logic error` could be having a single = symbol, rather than 3x = symbols, which would give us the wrong answer.

2. In the cookie-stand lab I was able to get the name of the new stand to print in my table, but the cookies would not print. I used console.log to check through what was going on, and I isolated the issue, but still couldn't figure out the "how". I got help from a TA and the answer was very clear. I was not passing a value into the constructor function, so of course the cookies wouldn't populate!

3. I do enjoy debugging. It's also an important part of programming. This topic will influence my long term goals by helping me isolate a spot to start on and just get to work, rather than trying to consume the entire thing at the same time.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. The JavaScript `Debugger tool` allows you to walk through the execution of your program one step at a time to isolate issues that arise.

2. A `breakpoint` is a step in the program that you set to stop the execution and see what's happening at that exact moment.

3. The `call stack` is the steps that have been executed to get you to the current breakpoint.
