# Class 3 Notes

## HTML

### (1.) You typically want to use an unordered list in HTML when you want items listed that don't have a numerical order to them, or the order would be meaningless. 

### (2.) You can change the bullet style through your CSS file with the list-style-type property.

### (3.) It is best to use an ordered list when the items have a meaning when they're in a particular order, and an unordered list when the order is irrelevant.

### (4.) Two ways you can change the numbers in an ordered list are writing ol type="i" for Roman Numerals, or ol start="3" to start the list at number 3. If you just have ol between the tags, the list will start with the number 1 as usual.

## CSS

### (1.) Margin and Padding play an important role in the story of "The Box Model". We're making a new sandwhich called The Box Model. In the Box Model sandwhich, the Margin would be the bread. It gives the sandwhich structure and keeps everything contained. The Padding in the Box Model sandwhich would be the cheese. It's role is to separate the meat and the bread on the Box Model sandwhich. It would be difficult to make a Box Model sandwhich without the margin/bread or padding/cheese!

### (2.) The four parts of an HTML elements box are the Margin, Border, Padding, and Content. Collectively, these make up the Box Model

## JavaScript

### (1.) In an Array, you can store strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays. The data types can also be mixed within an array

### (2.) Yes, it is a valid JavaScript array. You can access the values stored in the array by console.logging people and the array you want, starting with 0. 2 will pull up 'bill', null, 'artist', null.
