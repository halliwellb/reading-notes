# Class 3 Notes

## HTML

(1.) You typically want to use an unordered list in HTML when you want items listed that don't have a numerical order to them, or the order would be meaningless. 

(2.) You can change the bullet style through your CSS file with the list-style-type property.

(3.) It is best to use an ordered list when the items have a meaning when they're in a particular order, and an unordered list when the order is irrelevant.

(4.) Two ways you can change the numbers in an ordered list are writing ol type="i" for Roman Numerals, or ol start="3" to start the list at number 3. If you just have ol between the tags, the list will start with the number 1 as usual.

## CSS

(1.) Margin and Padding play an important role in the story of "The Box Model". We're making a new sandwhich called The Box Model. In the Box Model sandwhich, the Margin would be the bread. It gives the sandwhich structure and keeps everything contained. The Padding in the Box Model sandwhich would be the cheese. It's role is to separate the meat and the bread on the Box Model sandwhich. It would be difficult to make a Box Model sandwhich without the margin/bread or padding/cheese!

(2.) The four parts of an HTML elements box are the Margin, Border, Padding, and Content. Collectively, these make up the Box Model

## JavaScript

(1.) In an Array, you can store strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays. The data types can also be mixed within an array

(2.) Yes, it is a valid JavaScript array. You can access the values stored in the array by console.logging people and the array you want, starting with 0. 2 will pull up 'bill', null, 'artist', null.

### (3.) Five shorthand operators in JavaScript would be: 

**Assignment**, x = f() which assigns a value to a variable; 

**Remainder Assignment**, x%=f() which divides a variable by the value to the right, and assigns the remainder to the variable; 

**Addition Assignment** which adds the value of the right operand to the left operand *and assigns the result to the variable*; 

**Subtraction Assignment** which subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable *and assigns the result to the variable*;

**Multiplication Assignment** which multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand *and assigns the result to the variable*

(4.) 
let a = 10;
let b = 'dog';
let c = false;

// evaluate this

(a + c) + b;
 
I believe this will evaluate to false due to c = false
 
(5.) A conditional statement would be great for assessing whether a particular event has occured or not and having the user take different actions depending.

An example could be if the user is in a particular geographic location, show them this video clip, and if they are in a different location, show them a different clip.

Alternatively, offering the user a choice of what location they want to visit and showing them a different clip depending on their choice.

(6.) An example of when a Loop would be useful in programming is registering speed on a residential street using a speed gun attached to a billboard then spitting out the speed on the board. The board isn't storing the speed (although it could), it is more interested in capturing the momentary reading and displaying it, repeated for each vehicle that passes.
