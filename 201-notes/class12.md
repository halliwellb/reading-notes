# Chart.js, Canvas

## JavaScript Canvas

1. Canvas allows you to draw 2D graphics and animations using JavaScript.

2. The closing `</canvas>` tag tells the browser to show the content as a fallback if the browser doesn't support the `<canvas>` element.

3. The `getContext()` method lets you access the appropriate object to render, such as 2d.

## Chart.js Documentation

1. `Chart.js` allows you to incorporate charts in your HTML page. You can utilize it with in-line `script` tag, and then telling it what type of chart you want (`scatter`, `line`, `bar`, etc), with the corresponding data inputs.

2. `scatter`, `line`, `bar`, `pie`, `doughnut`

## Easily create stunning animated charts with Chart.js

1. Charts are much easier to consume and they are much less overwhelming to anyone who has not been marinating in the data. They also deliver actionable information much more quickly than tables.

2. `Chart.js` would have been useful to demonstrate the sales in the Salmon Cookies lab, perhaps how close the user was to the random number guessing game, and could have been really interesting to compare the new location suggestion from Salmon Cookies with the established locations to see any significant differences in the sales numbers.
