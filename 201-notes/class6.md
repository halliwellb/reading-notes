# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JS Object basics

1. An object is a container to store a single value or multiple values. An object can contain properties, which are stored data items and appear as objectname.property = value where objectname is the descriptor of the item, .property is something that is common across your objectname, and = value is the differentiator value. They also include methods, which allow the object to do something with the stored data.

2. The main advantage to creating object literals is the ability to send and retrieve a collection of information as a single object rather than as individual items describing the same subject, which is much more efficient. You can therefore store data on a subject in a database and retrieve it with just the object.

3. `Objects` represent a thing with multiple characteristics while `arrays` create and store a list of data in a variable. In other words, `objects` are descriptive while `arrays` are collective.

4. "If an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation" [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics).

5. In the code, `this` refers to the object dog and it will fill out "Spot is 14 in human years." when console.logged. the `this` keyword is very helpful when working with multiple object literals because it references and calls the data stored in the object. It can be used in place of writing `objectName` each time.

## Introduction to the DOM

1. The DOM is an acronym for `Document Object Model` and is the "data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web" [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction). It seems to me that the DOM is similar to a map for us to navigate through our HTML with JavaScript.
