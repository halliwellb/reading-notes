# Class Five notes

## HTML Media

1. A realworld use case for the `alt` attribute on a webpage would be for visually impaired users who are viewing the website through screen readers. The `alt` attribute could give those users a much clearer view of the site and images. Alternatively, if the site is taking a long time to load the images, the `alt` attribute can sub in for the image and not completely ruin the experience.

2. You can improve the accessibility of your webpage by including an `alt` attribute for your image and including captions for your image. They will serve different purposes, but if the image does not load they will both be visible. Captions can benefit those who are able to see the image also.

3. "A figure element specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc." [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figure.asp). A `figure` element can be helpful when you want to enclose an image along with a caption.

4. A `gif` is a simple animation or moving picture that is typically looped to repeat itself. It's simple to create which makes gifs popular. It can be thought of as a flip-book. An `SVG` is a type of file that stores an image. It is popular because you can expand or contract the size of the image without destroying the images quality; it will adjust to whatever size you set.

5. According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#svg_scalable_vector_graphics), a lossless WebP image would be the best choice because it maintains quality and is nicely compressed to make storing and sharing it simple.

1. `Foreground` color property will add color to the subject, such as the text, while the `Background` color property will add color to the background *behind* the foreground. For example, you could give a blue background with with foreground, and if you have text in that section it would contrast white on top of a blue background.

2. You could quickly add a nice background color, give the text a complementary contrasting foreground color, and perhaps add a nice border to the title with a different background and foreground color scheme than the body of the page. A great source of color schemes is [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create).

3. One of the most important considerations when thinking about font styles is *readability*. If the style makes the text even slightly more difficult to read, it should be changed. The font should be clean and appear clear and inviting. There are a lot of *cool* fonts out there, but fewer that are appropriate for an HTML that will be shown to anyone but yourself.

According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) it is also beneficial to add a **font stack** which means giving browsers multiple options to choose from when presenting your site. The browser will default to the first font *if available* and if necessary, continue until it findas an available font to use.

4. `Font-size` will change the size of specific sections in your HTML file. `Font-weight` will set how bold the text is in the section, similar to the bold function in a word processor. `Font-style` is used to turn italic text on or off, similar to the italics function in a word processor.

5. Two ways you could add spacing around the characters of an `h1` element are to use the `Text alignment` function to set the text left, right, or center, `Line height` function to set the height of each line of text, and in limited applications the `letter-spacing` or `word-spacing` properties which vary the spacing between words and letters in the section.
