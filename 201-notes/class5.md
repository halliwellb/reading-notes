# Class Five notes

## HTML Media

1. A realworld use case for the alt attribute on a webpage would be for visually impaired users who are viewing the website through screen readers. The alt attribute could give those users a much clearer view of the site and images. Alternatively, if the site is taking a long time to load the images, the alt attribute can sub in for the image and not completely ruin the experience.

2. You can improve the accessibility of your webpage by including an alt attribute for your image and including captions for your image. They will serve different purposes, but if the image does not load they will both be visible. Captions can benefit those who are able to see the image also.

3. "A figure element specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc." [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figure.asp). A figure element can be helpful when you want to enclose an image along with a caption.

4. A *gif* is a simple animation or moving picture that is typically looped to repeat itself. It's simple to create which makes gifs popular. It can be thought of as a flip-book. An *SVG* is a type of file that stores an image. It is popular because you can expand or contract the size of the image without destroying the images quality; it will adjust to whatever size you set.

5. According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#svg_scalable_vector_graphics), a lossless WebP image would be the best choice because it maintains quality and is nicely compressed to make storing and sharing it simple.
