## Local Storage and How to Use it on Websites

1. HTML doesn't inherently have a way to store a users state. When the user leaves the webpage, the page resets to it's original state. Using `local storage` is one way to give the web page a state other than the original state.

2. Any PII, passwords, usernames, user details, payment info, etc. According to this article at [dev.to](https://dev.to/rdegges/please-stop-using-local-storage-1i04), by Randall Degges, `local storage` is best used for information you wouldn't mind being posted to Facebook or put out publicly.

3. Local storage can store string information. With an adjustment you can convert number data to string, so you can store number data also. The `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods allow you to do this.
