# Class Four notes

## HTML & Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link we wrap text or content in tag a href="site">Description of link closing tag /a.

2. The href attribute contains the web address for the webpage to reference.

3. To make our links accessible to all readers, we can add descriptive **Titles** to our links which will pop up when a user hovers the mouse over the link and may read the text aloud, and concise wording for the text of our link.

## CSS Layout

1. *Normal flow* means default formatting. If you haven't applied any CSS to change the flow of the webpage, the browser will apply normal flow automatically.

2. Block-level and inline elements are two ways to tell the browser how to present your page. *Block-level* will fill the available space of the parent element (say the body) and grows with additional characters. *Inline* will adjust the size to the characters only and ignores its relative location in the parent element.

3. Static positioning is the default for every HTML element.

4. When used appropriately, absolute positioning can be a very handy tool to have available. You can make the prompts dynamically mobile on the page so the user can read any necessary information from the page to answer the prompt! Or you can set your logo to always appear at the top of the page no matter what else is happening, so you are always front of mind to the user.

5. *Absolute positioning* fixes an element in place relative to its nearest block, while *fixed positioning* fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the screen.


## Learn JS

1. A function *declaration* is setting a function initially for use later, while a function *invocation* is merely calling the preset function into action.

2. "Note: Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes." [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

## Misc.

1. Pair programming can help us uncover bugs more quickly and learn from our peers in a hands-on way that is conducive to many of us. This strategy can offer different perspective in real time, and stop us from going down an unneccessary rabbit hole that we later have to carefully dig out of. Finally, it can help us become more comfortable with coding in conjuction with another person, which could be very beneficial for job interviews or collaboration at work in this new field.
