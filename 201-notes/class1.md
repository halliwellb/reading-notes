## Basics

### (1.) HTTP

#### Browser sends request

#### The server approves the request

#### Server sends approve

### (2.) Parsing in the browser

#### The HTML is parsed first and sends requests back for any CSS files that are present, plus any script files present then parses both the CSS and JS files

#### The browser then works on all of the files to create the webpage laid out in the code for the user to interact with.

### (3.) Images

#### There are many great sources of **images**. Two that I've learned about from Code Fellows so far are [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) where you can check out both free and purchaseable images and [GoogleImages](https://www.google.com/search?q=bears&tbm=isch&tbs=il:cl&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwiwgJnVm8j9AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&biw=1519&bih=714) where you can select the option "Creative Commons licenses" to access many images that creators have allowed the public to use.

### (4.) Strings and Numbers

#### To create a string in JavaScript, we can write the text in single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or backquotes (``). To create a number in JavaScript, you can declare a variable such as myNumber and equate it to a number, then call the variable.

### (5.) Variables

#### According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics), a **variable** is a container that stores values in our code. Variables allow us to change the value stored and make our page more dynamic. An example would be personalizing a greeting, or parroting back a users favorite icecream flavor.

## HTML

### (1.) HTML attributes

#### An **HTML attribute** is a way that we can target the code for formatting purposes. Assigning an element an attribute can save a lot of time when you are trying to format multiple lines of similar code that are all over your file.

### (2.) Anatomy of an HTML element

#### An **HTML element** has an opening tag, closing tag, and content. All of this makes up an element.

### (3.) Article vs. Section tags

#### According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure), **article element tags** represent a block of content that can stand on its own meaning, without the context of the rest of the page. **Section tags** on the other hand are a piece of a whole page and would make less sense on their own.

### (4.) Elements in a website

#### A typical website will include the following **elements**: Body tags, Main tags, Article tags, Section tags, may include *Aside* tags and/or Nav tags, Header tags, and Footer tags.

### (5.) Metadata in SEO

#### The >Meta< element is used to tell the web browser various pieces of information about the site which can enrich the experience for users.

## Designing a website

### (1.) The first step to designing a website is to define your goals and vision for the site. What do you want to accomplish? 

### (2.) According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Design_and_accessibility/Thinking_before_coding), three questions are very important when designing a website. They are, "What exactly do I want to accomplish?", "How will a website help me reach my goals?", "What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?"

## Semantics

### (1.) Using an h1 tag gives the text importance as the top of your page. Using a span tag makes the section look like an h1 heading, but it will not have any semantic value, so the next coder reading it may be confused and left wondering why it wasn't an h1 to begin with.

### (2.) Semantics help communicate the purpose of code in an HTML document and leave the code cleaner. They provide clarity to others and ourselves when we come back to a block of code after a period of time.

## JavaScript

### (1.) Two things that *require* JavaScript on a webpage would be the use of variables to store information, and the ability to run code in response to events occurring on the webpage [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript).

### (2.) You can add JavaScript to a webpage either internally or externally. Internally you would use the script tags with your JavaScript enclosed, and externally you would use the script tags with the src= function enclosed.
