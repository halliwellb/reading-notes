## Basics

### (1.) HTTP

#### Browser sends request

#### The server approves the request

#### Server sends approve

### (2.) Parsing in the browser

#### The HTML is parsed first and sends requests back for any CSS files that are present, plus any script files present then parses both the CSS and JS files

#### The browser then works on all of the files to create the webpage laid out in the code for the user to interact with.

### (3.) Images

#### There are many great sources of images. Two that I've learned about from Code Fellows so far are [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) where you can check out both free and purchaseable images and [GoogleImages](https://www.google.com/search?q=bears&tbm=isch&tbs=il:cl&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwiwgJnVm8j9AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&biw=1519&bih=714) where you can select the option "Creative Commons licenses" to access many images that creators have allowed the public to use.

### (4.) Strings and Numbers

### (5.) Variables
