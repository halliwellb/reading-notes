# CSS Layout

## Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content, meaning it can work on rows `or` columns, one at a time, but not necessarily both at the `same` time.

2. The `main axis` is whichever `flex-direction` you set; `row` or `column`. The `cross axis` is whichever one you haven't selected for the `main axis`. Both of these allow you to set and move the items within each axis.

3. Using the `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` values can negatively impact accessibility. When the items are reversed, the screen readers that some users employ will still read the content in the logical order (reverse).

## CSS Layout Flexbox

1. `Flexbox` has many features that are superior to `float`. `Flexbox` allows you to center content both vertically and horizontally with two lines of CSS, rather than a dozen. It also allows you to set the items within a section to equally spaced distance all at once, rather than setting each one individually. Finally, you can set the height of items within a layout to be the same, even if they contain different amounts of content.

2. I don't love CSS, but I can see how Flexbox makes web design much cleaner. My wife and I used [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to create a site for her business [Bee Hoppy Flowers](https://www.beehoppyflowers.com/) and it felt very limiting with fonts, settings, sizes, etc. I can definitely see myself creating a new site with old fashioned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in time.
