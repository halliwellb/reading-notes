## CSS Transforms

1. A `CSS Transform` property allows the developer to access alternative ways to size, position, and change elements in ways that were previously very difficult or impossible.

2. 3D Cube would be really interesting as a rudimentary way to illustrate volume. My wife and I will be ordering compost for her business and it comes in cubic yards. How the heck do I know what a cubic yard looks like? Being able to visualize 5 cubic yards (using the 3D Cube feature) placed inside of a swimming pool or something would be very helpful to understand whether I have enough or need way more. I know what a swimming pools volume looks like, so seeing it inside of that would connect the dots more effectively for me.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. A `CSS Transition` lets the developer change an element when a state change occurs, such as hovering, clicking, etc. You can also set the duration of the change, whether instant or delayed.

2. `CSS Transition` takes an element from one state to another, or "single state changes" [ShayHowe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/#animations:~:text=Transitions%20do%20a%20great%20job%20of%20building%20out%20visual%20interactions%20from%20one%20state%20to%20another%2C%20and%20are%20perfect%20for%20these%20kinds%20of%20single%20state%20changes.) while `CSS animations` allow the developer to take transitions through multiple state changes, fluidly.

## 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users

1. Using `CSS Transition` on websites can enhance a users experience when done correctly, and improve their perception of the site. This improved perception could lead to more engagement and 'clicks' or shares. Plus, a lot of them are just plain cool.

2. I'm not 100% sure how I'd use `CSS Transition` or `CSS Transform` or `CSS Animation` in my long-term goals. Jacob showed me this really cool [A-Frame site](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/modelviewer/) where you can use VR with just JavaScript and HTML. So this feels kind of similar, with the 3D Cube from `CSS Transforms`, and I could see myself doing something like that as practice.
