# What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

## Discussion Questions

1. Allowing each member of the team to speak equally, being aware of your "social sensitivity" towards your teammates, and being open to a level of vulnerability are three key factors.

2. It was interesting to hear about the performance improvement when everyone in a team had the opportunity to speak roughly the same amount.

I think that would be a great tool to employ when hiring someone in the future as it can help in the decision making process. Even if we don't score well on it, we will still learn a lot about our willingness to improve our 'soft skills'. I'm also going to save this article and refer to it when looking for new jobs. I think it's a great mindset primer in how to approach a new opportunity.

Before I joined Code Fellows, I worked for a fee-only financial planning office with two other guys; very small team and they worked together extremely well, despite the two guys being totally different. Mr. A was extremely analytical and the Mr. B was much more present (or had a higher EQ)you could say. I was and am a lot like Mr. A, so he and I butted heads almost constantly. I didn't offer either of them a space to be comfortable speaking their minds because my expectations of them were just as high as their's of me. I definitely got back what I gave and have no one to thank but myself.

After reading this article, I can see how our interactions were building a wholly unsustainable pressure, rather than creating an environment where it could be relieved a little at a time. That was not a fun environment for anyone to work in and I think everyone was relieved when I left.

Reflecting on the situation, I think it was a good learning opportunity to really check myself for my expectations and to be mindful of staying open to other perspectives and ways of being.

3. Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety are able to elevate the ability of each member and become greater than the sum of their parts. This has exponential impacts on the outcomes the members can realize together, and flows through to the company. It is a difficult environment to unlock, and even more difficult to sustain, but it is well worth the effort of the team.
