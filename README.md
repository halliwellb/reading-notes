# My Reading Journal

Hi! My name is Ben Halliwell. I am learning about tech and having my mind blown daily. I'm a USMC veteran with a finance background, but I've been consistently impressed by the reach and impact that tech has. My long-term goal is to work in VR supporting environmental conservation efforts using [photogrammetry](https://blog.unity.com/aec/the-power-of-photogrammetry-simulating-the-real-world-in-vr) to communicate the importance of conservation with the broader public in an entertaining and engaging way.

My best contact information is by email at bkhalliwell@outlook.com.
